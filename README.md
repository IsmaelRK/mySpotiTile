# mySpotiTile
A Spotify API-based tile game built over a weekend. Runs in browser with PKCE. You will need a spotify premium account to play it. This is a personal project with no affiliation to Spotify.


If you want to download and try it you will probably need to change the **client id** and the **redirect url**.
I really would like to add more updates like a good mobile compatibility and a synchronized generations of tiles according to the music beat, but my time is up for now.
